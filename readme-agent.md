QueryClip Project Summary
What We've Done
Transcript Outline Improvements:
Reduced padding in the outline container from p-6 to p-4
Changed font size from prose-lg to regular prose with text-sm
Made list items more compact with space-y-0.5 instead of space-y-1
Added leading-snug to list items for tighter line spacing
Reduced heading sizes from text-lg to text-base
Decreased spacing between elements for a more compact layout
Screenshot Caption Improvements:
Changed from leading-snug to leading-tight for tighter line spacing
Added processing to replace double line breaks with single line breaks
Attempted to optimize bullet point formatting to reduce excess spacing
Next Steps
Complete the implementation of tighter spacing in the ScreenshotGallery component
Improve the bullet point formatting by modifying the caption text processing
Add regex to optimize bullet point formatting by removing excess spaces
Review and test changes to ensure they meet the desired compact layout across the application
Address any remaining areas with inconsistent spacing
Project Orientation
Application Overview
QueryClip is a video analysis tool that allows users to transcribe videos, take screenshots, and generate notes and summaries.

Key Components
App.jsx: Main application component that orchestrates all other components and handles state management for the entire application.
TranscriptViewer.jsx/FullTranscriptViewer.jsx: Display video transcripts, with features like auto-scrolling and copying content to clipboard (with or without timestamps).
EnhancedScreenshotManager.jsx: Manages the process of capturing screenshots from videos, including features for:
Immediate capture of screenshots
"Mark mode" for queueing future screenshot captures
Processing screenshots with optional captions
ScreenshotGallery.jsx: Displays captured screenshots with their captions and timestamps, allowing for:
Caption editing
Adding notes to screenshots
Viewing timestamps when screenshots were taken
NotesManager.jsx: Handles note-taking and export options, including:
Managing text notes about the video
Processing images for export
Integration with external tools (like Notion)
Clipboard functionality
CaptureControls.jsx/MarkModeControls.jsx: UI components for controlling screenshot capture, with visual feedback for the user.
Styling Approach
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with classes like:

leading-snug/leading-tight for line spacing control
Size modifiers like text-sm, text-base
Spacing utilities like p-4, space-y-0.5
Core Features
Video transcription and display
Screenshot capture with timestamps
Notes and export functionality
Transcript outline generation
Copy to clipboard features
This structure provides a modular approach to managing video content, with separate components handling different aspects of the application's functionality.
